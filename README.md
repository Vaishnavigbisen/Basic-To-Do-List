This is a really basic implementation of a Todo List.I made it when I started with Web Development. This ToDo List supports both add and delete operations. When you enter a Task inside the form and select add option it get's added to the pending list. When you click on an item in the pending list it gets removed.And the completed task is shown in completed list. I also implemented dark mode in website. It is also responsive in nature.
